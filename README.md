Mapping canopy cover for the central valley
***************************************************************************************
NOTE: This repository has two tracts: One generates census tract level data for c. 2016 whole California Central Valley
The other tract generates census block group level data for 2021 San Joaquin Valley


Files 00, 01 and 02 are Google earth engine scripts, a GEE account is needed to rerun them

File 03 accesses both the US Census API and Google Earth Engine, a Census API key and access to a Google Drive is required to run this script

File 04 uses the output of File 03 in GEE for visualization, the output can be viewed on the app here without having run any of the previous scripts:
